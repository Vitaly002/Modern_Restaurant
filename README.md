# Modern_Restaurant

Modern_Restaurant (Gericht) is a beautifully designed, static restaurant website focused on aesthetics, responsiveness, and cross-platform compatibility. This project showcases a modern restaurant layout with engaging components, clean typography, and seamless integration of imagery and content, designed to provide a rich, visual user experience. Though static, the project highlights the power of thoughtful design, offering an appealing digital presence for restaurants.

## Features

Responsive Design: Fully responsive across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Static Content: There’s no dynamic interaction, but the design elements create a sophisticated, user-friendly experience.

Cross-Platform: Ensures uniform appearance and functionality on multiple platforms and screen sizes.

### Technologies Used

React.js: For building reusable UI components and structuring the layout.
