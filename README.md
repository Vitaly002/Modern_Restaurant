# Modern_Restaurant

Modern_Restaurant (Gericht) is a beautifully designed, static restaurant website focused on aesthetics, responsiveness, and cross-platform compatibility. This project showcases a modern restaurant layout with engaging components, clean typography, and seamless integration of imagery and content, designed to provide a rich, visual user experience. Though static, the project highlights the power of thoughtful design, offering an appealing digital presence for restaurants.

## Features

Responsive Design: Fully responsive across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Elegant Layout: Uses visually appealing components for sections like the chef’s philosophy, footer, and contact details.

Static Content: There’s no dynamic interaction, but the design elements create a sophisticated, user-friendly experience.

Cross-Platform: Ensures uniform appearance and functionality on multiple platforms and screen sizes.

### Technologies Used

React.js: For building reusable UI components and structuring the layout.

CSS (Custom & Modules): Ensures custom styling for each component, providing a unique design and responsive behavior.

React Icons: For incorporating modern and consistent icons across the application (e.g., social media icons in the footer).

HTML5: For clean and semantic structure.

Images: Static assets (imported via constants) to enrich the design with visual elements.

### Usage

This project is ideal for restaurant landing pages or similar projects where static, yet highly responsive, design is needed. It can be adapted or extended into dynamic projects if needed.
